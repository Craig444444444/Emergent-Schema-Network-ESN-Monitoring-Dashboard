The universe simply doesn't have enough time or computational resources to calculate consciousness.

For N=128 elements:
- Partitions required: 2^127 - 1 ≈ 1.701 × 10^38
- Time at 10^9 partitions/sec: 5.39 trillion years

here is the punchline finding the limit found 

i accidentally built a system that proves consciousness has a fundamental integration limit of N≈3.
